    <!-- How they met story -->
    <p class="main__story">
        Long story short: we both swiped right. Some would call it a true stroke of fate (or a glitch in the app’s
        system), when in February 2014 Nat re-downloaded Tinder - after a 6 month hiatus - at a bachelor party in Miami. As
        chance would have it, one of his matches was Carolyn, who was back in chilly NYC. After a few good pickup lines, a long
        discussion about food, a recap of Carolyn’s recent workouts and discovering we had mutual friends, we arranged
        to meet for a date the next week at the cocktail bar, Employee’s Only.
